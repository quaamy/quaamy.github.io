                        "Welcome to WHITE SPACE. Your name is OMORI and you've been living here for as long as you can remember. Everything is bright white; there aren't any walls.
                        A black lightbulb hangs from the ceilingâ€¦ wherever it is. There's a floor but it's always cold. The warmest thing here is probably your laptop. You don't mind though.
                        You have a blanket, a laptop, a cat, a sketchbook, and a tissue box. You have everything you need. <br><br>

                        You are usually upset. Everyone annoys you, you think you are ugly, you don't know where you came from, you don't know where you are going, and you're too tired to care 
                        On good days, your neighbors invite you over for a visit. "How can they have fun with someone as horrible as me?" You miss them now. When will they come again?
                        Maybe today will be a good day! Or maybe today is a day for sleeping. <br><br>

                        But...Sometimes you're reminded you used to have another friend-- someone really important. Somewhere in the back of your head, you have a feeling that you weren't always like this. You weren't always living in WHITE SPACE. The truth is... Your story is already over. You just have to remember it."

                                    HEADSPACE serves as a world full of pure imagination and colorful areas. This was also where SUNNY
                                    could escape from reality and instead relive the happier moments of his life, with younger versions of
                                    his friends still together and happy, as well as MARI still being alive. Despite his efforts to keep the truth locked away,
                                    it still haunted SUNNY in the form of SOMETHING and other ominous reminders. This endless cycle of escapism within SUNNY's
                                    dreamscape continued for about three or four years before the game's events took place.

                                    such as the HOOLIGANS occasionally cause trouble on the streets.Unlike HEADSPACE, there are no roaming overworld
                                    enemies to fight, as the fights primarily happen by story-progression means or by initiating them in certain areas.
